    <p class="text">QTS attained via QTLS status depends on an active membership with the Society for Education <br/>
      and Training (SET). If you hold QTS only via QTLS and SET membership and your membership ends, <br/>
      you will lose QTS. If you were directly awarded QTS (for example, following initial teacher training) <br/>
      as well as holding QTS via QTLS and SET membership and your membership ends, you will not lose QTS. <br/>
      However, your exemption from induction will end.</p>
