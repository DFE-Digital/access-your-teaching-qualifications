    <p>A teacher’s record includes their qualifications and also tells you if they:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>passed their induction</li>
      <li>are prevented from teaching by a prohibition order</li>
      <li>were sanctioned by the General Teaching Council for England (GTCE)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can search for a teacher’s record using their last name and date of birth.</p>
    <p>You should <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dbs-identity-checking-guidelines">confirm the teacher’s identity</a> before you check their record.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Before you start</h2>
    <p>You need a DfE Sign-in account. If you do not have one then you can:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>ask your organisation’s approver to create an account for you</li>
      <li>use the <a href="https://help.signin.education.gov.uk/contact-us">contact form</a> to request an account if you do not have an approver</li>
      <li>email <a href="mailto:teaching.status@education.gov.uk">teaching.status@education.gov.uk</a> if you work for a teacher supply agency – you should normally receive a response within 5 working days</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you need to check a teacher’s record while you wait for your DfE Sign-in account, email <a href="mailto:employer.access@education.gov.uk">employer.access@education.gov.uk</a> and say ‘urgent query’ in the subject line.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Qualified teacher learning and skills (QTLS) status</h2>
    <p>A teacher’s record will not tell you if they have QTLS. You need to check the <a href="https://set.et-foundation.co.uk/your-career/professional-status-register">Society for Education and Training professional register</a>.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">School managers and governors</h2>
    <p>There’s a separate <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/individuals-prohibited-from-managing-or-governing-schools">list of people who are not allowed to manage or govern schools</a>. This is called the section 128 list.</p>
